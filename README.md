# Recruitment Task for Web Developer Position

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the implementation plan for integrating the DataTables library into a WordPress-based website. The data for the table will be temporarily sourced from the provided `table.txt` file, which contains the HTML code for the table. During this implementation, we will not utilize any plugins from the marketplace; instead, we will focus on direct integration of the library through HTML and JavaScript code. The table will be displayed using a shortcode and fully loaded on the page, with the ability to embed it within HTML or JavaScript code.

## Implementation Plan

The implementation plan includes the following steps:

1. **Adding the DataTables library to the WordPress site**
2. **Creating a shortcode to display the table with data from the `table.txt` file**
3. **Initializing DataTables in JavaScript**
4. **Testing functionality and optimizing performance**
5. **Customizing the appearance of the table and updating data**

## Documentation
